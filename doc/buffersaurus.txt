COMMANDS~

:Bdg[rep][!] {pattern}
                    Search buffer(s) for the regular expression |pattern|
                    given by {pattern}. If 'g:bdex_default_single_file' is not
                    defined or true, then all buffers will be searched unless
                    the 'bang' operator is given, in which case the search
                    will be limitd to the current buffer. Otherwise, if
                    'g:bdex_default_single_file' is defined and true, then
                    only the current buffer will be searched unless the bang
                    operator is given, in which the search will be across all
                    buffers. If 'g:bdex_set_search_register' is not false (0),
                    then the pattern will also be assigned to the search
                    register.

:Bdt[oc]!
                    Generate a "table of contents" type catalog for buffers,
                    based on the specific filetype of each buffer. If
                    'g:bdex_default_single_file' is not defined or true, then
                    all buffers will be searched unless the 'bang' operator is
                    given, in which case the search will be limitd to the
                    current buffer. Otherwise, if 'g:bdex_default_single_file'
                    is defined and true, then only the current buffer will be
                    searched unless the bang operator is given, in which the
                    search will be across all buffers. See
                    |buffersaurus-filetype-patterns| for more information on
                    the patterns to be matched.

:Bdi[ndex]! {term-name}
                    Generate a catalog of occurrences of the term pattern
                    named {term-name} in buffers. If
                    'g:bdex_default_single_file' is not defined or true, then
                    all buffers will be searched unless the 'bang' operator is
                    given, in which case the search will be limitd to the
                    current buffer. Otherwise, if 'g:bdex_default_single_file'
                    is defined and true, then only the current buffer will be
                    searched unless the bang operator is given, in which the
                    search will be across all buffers. See
                    |buffersaurus-term-patterns| for information on defining
                    and using terms.

:Bdo[pen]
                    (Re-)open the most recent catalog.

:Bdn[ext]
                    Go to the next matched line from the most recent catalog
                    (like |:cnext|).

:Bdp[rev]
                    Go to the previous matched line from the most recent
                    catalog (like |:cprev|).

:Bds[tatus][!]
                    Show brief (without '!') or detailed (with '!') description
                    of the most recent catalog.

:Bdf[ilter][!] [pattern]
                    Without '!': filter results to only show lines matching
                    [pattern]. If [pattern] is not given, then the previous
                    filter pattern will be used. If there is no previous
                    filter pattern, then the user will be prompted for a new
                    pattern. With '!': remove filter. In all cases if
                    [pattern] is '*' or '.*', then the saved pattern will be
                    cleared and the filter removed. Only available when in a
                    catalog buffer.

OPTIONS AND SETTINGS~

The following options can be used to customize the behavior of this plugin.

g:bdex_sort_regime
    Sets the default sort regime for results:
        'fl': sort by filepath, then line number [default]
        'fa': sort by filepath, then alphabetically by line text
        'a' : sort alphabetically by line text

g:bdex_move_wrap
    If true [default], then result navigation wraps (i.e., moving to a 'next'
    result when already on the last result goes to the first result, while
    moving to a 'previous' result when already on the first result goes to the
    last result). If false, then result navigation does not wrap.

g:bdex_set_search_register
    If true [default], then ":Bdgrep {pattern}" assigns {pattern} to the
    search register.
